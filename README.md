#MDAS - MARTIAN DUST ALERT SYSTEM
#Martian Dust storms surely pose a threat to future human settlements. We propose a simple and easy to deploy, yet reliable, #system to provide early alerts.
#We have designed a system based on ground meteorological ministations (16 stations for this project) deployed around a human #Martian colony. Each of these stations continuously senses wind speed, pressure, temperature and particle concentration. With #our own algorithm, we are able to obtain an interpolated and extrapolated fields of these measures. Using saltation models #covered in previous research, conditions for dust storm triggering can be determined. With that data being processed, an #early alert can be given to the colony. Also, the model allows to classify the storms according to their intensity and, in #that way, generate an adequate alert type. 
#
#In summary, this system provides humans in Mars with sufficient time to take preventive measures before the storm arrives, #not only for themselves, but also for the infrastructure (rovers, experiments, solar panels...), switching them automatically #to safe mode to avoid damage. The reliability of this system (it has redundancy) and the accuracy of its model, along with #the ease of deployment and low maintenance requirements, makes it perfect to a first stage human colony in the Red Planet.
